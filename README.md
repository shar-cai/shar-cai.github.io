# GitHub Pages Portfolio (2 pages)

This is a super-simple starter that uses **GitHub Pages + Jekyll (minima theme)** and only Markdown files.

## How to use
1. Create a new public repo named **`YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`** on GitHub.
2. Download this folder as a ZIP and upload the contents to that repo (or clone and copy).
3. Commit & push. GitHub Pages will build automatically and your site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.
4. Edit the text in `index.md`, `projects.md`, and `about.md`.
5. In `_config.yml`, replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and your LinkedIn link. You can also change the theme later.

> Tip: you can add images by putting files under `assets/img/` and linking to them like `/assets/img/your-image.jpg`.
