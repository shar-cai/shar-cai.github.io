Hi, my name is Sharon (Shar) Cai, and I recently graduated from McMaster University with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering (B.Eng.BME).

What I love most about engineering is the potential for imaginative creation, the ability to transform a mere concept into something real and tangible that people can interact with. Whether it's a physical device or a digital platform, being able to build systems that make a difference is exceptionally rewarding to me. 

I really enjoy working across disciplines, blending software, mechanical design, and electronics into integrated systems. That’s why mechatronics was the perfect fit: it allowed me to explore a wide range of interests while giving me the tools to bring complex ideas to life.

Overall, what drives me most is impact. I find it fulfilling to build solutions that can help someone, whether it's for one person or a million. Along the way, I’ve worked on projects spanning biomedical robotics, embedded control systems, real-time applications, and interactive software platforms. Each one has reinforced my excitement for continuous learning and my passion for innovative technologies.

My current focus and skills:
- **Interests:** embedded systems, real‑time control, biomedical robotics, computer vision, and UI/UX.
- **Toolbox:** Python, C/C++, TypeScript/JS, SQL, React, MATLAB, Simulink, Solidworks, CATIA, Wireshark, Linux, Git
- **Currently:** Applying to full‑time roles and working on fun side projects!
- **Hobbies:** watercolour painting, co-op video games, rock climbing (mainly bouldering, but I love a good outdoor top rope climb)
