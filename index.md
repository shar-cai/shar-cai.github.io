# Hi, I'm Sharon ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦ˆ

Welcome to my mini portfolio. I build things that are a mix of **software**, **hardware**, and a dash of **mechanical design**, with a pinch of sugar, spice, and everything nice.

- See my **[Projects](/projects)** for pictures and notes.
- Learn more **[About Me](/about)**.

Highlights:

- [**Capstone: Magnetically Actuated Soft Continuum Robot for ENT Surgery**](/projects#capstone) â€” a soft continuum robot for enhanced dexterity in navigating complex/confined anatomical spaces with minimized invasiveness during ENT surgery.
- [**Interview Buddy**](/projects#interview-buddy) â€” Web app that records responses to randomized interview questions and uses machine learning and computer vision to analyze eye contact, tone, speech patterns, and answer quality, returning a scored report with actionable feedback.

> Thanks for stopping by!
