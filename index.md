# Hi, I'm Shar ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I build things across embedded systems, software, and ML.

- See my **[Projects](/projects)** for demos and notes.
- Learn more **[About Me](/about)**.

If you're in a hurry, here are a few highlights:

- **Protect: An Active Gaming Experience** â€” Arcade-style interactive wall + ball launcher prototype (Raspberry Pi network, PyGame, JSON-configurable game modes).
- **Interview Buddy** â€” Web app that analyzes recorded interview answers with CV/NLP pipelines.
- **Mastermordle** â€” Word game with a Mastermind-style feedback twist (Node + TS).
