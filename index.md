<br>
Welcome to my mini portfolio. I build things that are a mix of **software**, **hardware**, a dash of **mechanical design**, with a pinch of sugar, spice, and everything nice!

- See my **[Projects](/projects)** for pictures and notes.
- Learn more **[About Me](/about)**.
- My resume: [Download my resume (PDF)](/assets/files/Sharon_Cai_Resume.pdf)

Highlights:
- [Capstone: Magnetically Actuated Soft Continuum Robot for ENT Surgery](/projects#capstone) -- a soft continuum robot for enhanced dexterity in navigating complex/confined anatomical spaces with minimized invasiveness during ENT surgery.
- [Interview Buddy](/projects#interview-buddy) -- web app that records responses to randomized interview questions and uses machine learning and computer vision to analyze eye contact, tone, speech patterns, and answer quality, returning a scored report with actionable feedback.
