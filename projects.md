Below are a few projects I’ve worked on.

## Capstone: Magnetically Actuated Soft-Continuum Robot (ENT) {#capstone}
### Why we built this
Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery often means working inside exceptionally narrow, twisty passages where rigid tools can struggle to maneuver without damaging surrounding tissue. In some cases, surgeons must enlarge pathways by removing bone to reach a target or gain vision in an area. After speaking with sinus surgeons and researching current techniques, it was clear there was room for a gentler, more dexterous approach that can navigate tight anatomy without adding trauma.

We set out to build a magnetically steered soft-continuum robot. The objective was to keep the instrument compliant inside the anatomy, shift actuation from outside the body via controlled magnetic fields, and coordinate it with a linear stage to orient the tip precisely and advance along that heading.

> **Need Statement**  
> Design a magnetically actuated continuum robot for use in ENT surgery, enhancing dexterity in navigating complex and confined anatomical spaces while remaining less invasive than current tools.
